# ButtonCodingChallenge
Button!
I've created this App using Model View Presenter.
I used Room Database to store users and took precaution to prevent race conditions to properly read and write on database.
Delete users which will delete on both client and server side.
Add new users by pressing the floating action button on the bottom right to add on both client and server side.
You can make transfer for specific users via their id.
You can view all transfer by pressing "view transfer" which is located on the top right corner of the app.

Thank you for reading this!
